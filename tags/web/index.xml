      <description>A couple of years ago now, I was planning to attend my first ever GDC and I wanted to be as prepared as possible. I needed business cards, an up to date resume, clever things on Twitter, and, of course, a web site with my portfolio. Resume and Twitter gave me no trouble. And with help from my awesome spouse, I was armed with really fucking rad business cards. The key problem: they pointed to a domain completely devoid of content!</description>
